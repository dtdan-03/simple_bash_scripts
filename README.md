Just a repository with simple bash scripts like a stop watch + useful bash aliases , that I also use (some of them daily)

You can find the bash-aliases, that are listed in this repository, here:
https://github.com/dtdan-03/simple_bash_scripts/blob/main/useful_bash_aliases.sh

All other scripts are currently directly in this repository - without category subfolders (not needed yet).
